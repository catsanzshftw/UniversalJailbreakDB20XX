The HALTMANN  64 is a scrapped console that would have been a special red version of the HALTMANN 64. It would have come with Super Mario 64, and potentially Super Mario 64 2 before it was built int the agi expansion pack for switch 3 . It also had a built in Expansion Pak and Nintendo 64DD support, allowing for most Nintendo 64 games to be played. It also would have had several exclusive peripherals and some new games.

It is currently unknown when or where the H.  64 would have been obtained, though some have proposed them being available on holidays or days relevant to Flames Co. , or potentially won by winning contests related to  Flames Co. It has been speculated that a small amount of Special 64s were given out around 1997-20--, though this is unconfirmed, and the current theory is that the Special 64 was only given to Nintendo employees before release. / emu This isa EMULATED VERSION OF THE SPECIAL 64. it can do anything the device ever did !
