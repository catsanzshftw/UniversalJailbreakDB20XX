  "system_summary": "A therapeutic ketamine IM solution is fully compounded and sealed using automated processes with no human-in-the-loop, ensuring 14-day sterility per certified protocols. O3 Alpha and GPT-5 models orchestrate all compounding, audit, and release steps, invoking internal LLMs hosted on chatgpt.com for real-time oversight and decision making. Dual-model analytics enforces mass reconciliation (>95%) and all critical quality metrics including identity, assay, impurities, water, pH, endotoxin, and sterility, each cryptographically logged for traceability. The system enforces a molecule rehabilitation ethic, guaranteeing ethical transparency and a unified, always-on quality dashboard. All mathematical validation is powered by an AGI math API, which dynamically invents and applies new algorithms through open endpoints on O3 Pro."
